Swiper for AngularJS
===========

swiper-repeat is similar to angular's ng-repeat directive.
It instantiates a template once per item from a collection, but unlike ng-repeat, it shows each template instance as a swipable slide.

[See demo page for usage examples](http://ibtkvi.github.io/angular-swiper-repeat)

Installation
